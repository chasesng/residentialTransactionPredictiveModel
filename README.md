# Residential Property Transaction Predictive Model
This code is used to build a machine learning model used to predict the price per sqft of resale properties in Singapore, with input of the year, property type, and postal district.

This model utilizes Tensorflow, Pandas, Keras, scikit-learn to be trained on property transactions in Singapore from May 2018 to May 2023.
The dataset it utilizes contains the transactions' Project Name, Transacted Price, Area (SQFT), Unit Price ($ PSF), Sale Date, Property Type, Postal District.
Dataset is obtained from https://www.ura.gov.sg/property-market-information/pmiResidentialTransactionSearch


## Roadmap

- Improve model accuracy for wider range of years.


## Notes

This model was created as I wanted to develop a site to showcase the comparison between rising resale property prices juxtaposed with inflation in Singapore.
